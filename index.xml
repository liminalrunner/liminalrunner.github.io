&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wednesday (28th of October): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday (30th of October): Final Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Only 2 runs counting towards this week, because I already did the Tired Run that was usually on Monday, on &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-15-weekly-update-20/">Sunday last week&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
The last run was first planned for Saturday, as almost every Long Run i did so far, but on Friday, after 2 days of rain the weather opened up and I could free up some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 0:30 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 0:30 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For this final speed repeat workout, the intervals got even shorter. Hitting a certain pace window in this short interval is just something that feels really hard to do for me.
Distance: 4.61km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="friday-run">Friday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 21.10 km&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The final run, that I have been looking forward to, but also was anxious to see if i really could hit the target pace of 7:35 min/km to hit that 2h40min goal time. I achieved that, with an asterisk.&lt;br>
The path I was running is a mix of gravel and concrete and I was going for an out and back run. The path has multiple smaller streams crossing it, which are easily navigated through by using bigger stones in it or a small wooden path over it, for which I would&amp;rsquo;ve just slowed down, if they would&amp;rsquo;ve been wet. What I did not anticipate was that there was so much water, that the streams were flooding the way and covering the stones completely. I had to backtrack and find a way were I can jump/cross it safely. For that I stopped my the timer on my watch.&lt;br>
It being autumn and having rained for the last 2 days, the path was covered in a ton of wet leaves. Which wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem till around 17km in i slipped and landed on my ass. Had to walk for under a minute after that but got running again to finish it up.
There were also some muddy areas from someone driving around with a tractor or some other farming equipment, which I had to slow down a bit for.
Overall, my running time was 2h38min50sec, all included other than me looking how to cross the streams. That averages to 7:32min/km. I was just below my target pace/goal time, which I am very happy with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I noticed was that stamina wasn&amp;rsquo;t the problem, but in my knees I was feeling the load starting to stack up about 2/3rds of the way in and it kept building up. They were done after the run and 2 days after that. My lower back also started hurting a bit around the same time, because my form got sloppy and I sturted to hunch my back, which I do way to often during my day behind my desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I actually reached to new personal bests with this run, obviously the half-marathon, but also the 10K with a 1h13min12sec.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weekly distance was 25.71km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am planning on writing a final review of my experience with this Garmin Coach Half-Marathon Training plan in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-13-weekly-update-18/">3 weeks ago&lt;/a>, I wrote that I was thinking about getting a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; coach. I was looking for someone who is both an experienced runner and maybe has some sort of scientific background. I don&amp;rsquo;t care to much to &amp;ldquo;push my 5k/10k time&amp;rdquo; to a certain finish time and compare myself to others, because that train has sailed a long time ago, I am starting at age 34 and also, I enjoyed pushing the distance and challenging myself that way. So the coach should also be someone more distance oriented. And lastly also someone affordable. At this point I cannot justify spending 200$ or more a month for coaching. I just want to make clear, that I am not saying that it could not be worth that much.&lt;br>
For the long term, and I mean more like (a) year(s) and not weeks or months, I&amp;rsquo;ve set my sight on working towards an ultra marathon. Which is a scary thing to do from my perspective, because I am both overweight and my general fitness isn&amp;rsquo;t good, but I enjoy the challenge of distance far more than I enjoy the challenge of speed, if that makes sense. And for that I want a coach, because I want to get there as injury free and healthy as possible and just jumping from one training plan (that is usually aimed at the &amp;ldquo;average person&amp;rdquo;) to the next might work for most people, but for me I want someone I can talk to to make adjustments and help me reach that far fetched goal in a healthy way.&lt;br>
I looked around the internet and got in touch and had a call with one during this week. I was very happy with our conversation and I am looking forward to working with that Coach. For the coming weeks, we agreed to just get me adjusted to the coaches training style, without working towards a goal other than improving my general fitness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Posts here may be a bit less frequent till the end of the year, but I will keep posting about my progress and as I meantioned above, there will be a review of the Garmin Coach plan coming.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 10.08km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sunday-run">Sunday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 5.65km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today was such nice weather, that I decided to do tomorrows run today. Just to try it out before the &amp;ldquo;Goal Race&amp;rdquo; next week, I wanted to try to run at a slightly faster pace than the goal pace of 7:35min/km. I ended up averaging 7:06min/km which felt totally fine, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally out of breath or anything like that. Funnily enough, this run also improved my 5k personal best from &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week8/">the end of my 5k training plan in July&lt;/a>, by 8 seconds to 35:22, without actually going hard at it. I assume I could probably knock down somewhere between 1 or 2 minutes of that time if I really tried for that distance.&lt;br>
This weeks distance, inlucding todays run, which normally should be counted towards next week, was 36.90km.&lt;br>
This leaves just 2 runs for the final week, a short speed repeats run and the final half-marathon run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To read how i fared, read next weeks post!&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Thursday (14th of October): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday (18th of October): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Almost a usual week, but I had to schedule the long run for sunday instead of saturday.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 11.26km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The longest &amp;ldquo;Tired Run&amp;rdquo; so far. I could still feel Saturdays run a little bit in my legs, but no problems on the run after I was a few hundret meters into it.
Distance: 11.56km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 1:00 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 1:00 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>8 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 3:30 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 3:30 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Something new this week! First short 1min intervals, then 3:30min intervals. The 1min intervals again were a problem of nailing the pace in that &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; time window, but the longer intervals felt good.
Distance: 11.11km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 7.02km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sunday-run">Sunday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 12.87km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 13.26
Compared to last week this was almost 10km shorter, which I guess the plan wanted to balance that out a bit, which is fine, because the speed repeats were actually a longer run this time around. The total weekly distance was 42.95km, which is dialed back from last week, but I assume the plan is tapering down a bit towards the end.&lt;/p>

This week had a Time Trial, with new personal bests and the first long run over the 21.1km half marathon distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday (6th of October): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (7th of October): Time Trial&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (8th of October): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (11th of October): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Monday had an all day rainstorm and while I don&amp;rsquo;t mind running in a bit of rain, I actually like it, running in a storm is a different beast. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason why I pushed the run to Tuesday.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 10.46km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 10.77km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 0.80 km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 1.61km | Time Trial | Give your best effort!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speed Drills 4 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 0.40km | 7:35 to 7:54 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 0.40km | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Time Trial and Speed Drills all in one run!
As I mentioned before on intervals, I am horrible at judging my pace. I ran the first 0.40km at a 4:45 to 4:55 pace, which was way to fast. After I noticed that, I slowed down for 5 seconds and then continued at a 5:40ish pace, slowed further down to a 6:20ish pace when I noticed I still could go faster for the rest and went in a 5:35 pace on the last 0.20km. For those 1.61km aka 1 mile, I had an average pace of 5:38min/km, which translates to 9:04.2 min/mile. This is a new personal best for me, the previous being from the first time trial of this training plan on the 26th of August, which was 6:02min/km or 9:42.8min/mile. Included in this was also a new 1km personal best with 5:27.5min/km with the previous being 5:54.9min/km, also from the same time trial in August. Which was a good improvement on paper, but being a bad judge at pace, I have no idea if these two runs were at an comperable effort.
After the time trial I took a minute or two of walking to normalize my breathing and got into the speed repeats, which for the first time was at a tempo near my target &amp;ldquo;race pace&amp;rdquo; of 7:35 min/km.
Distance: 7.49km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 6.87km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 22.53km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The first run which not only reached the 21.1km for the half-marathon, but went even further than that. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look at my watch at all and tried to figure out an easy pace. I stopped 4 times for traffic lights (for which i paused the run timer), but other than that I ran the distance without stopping. At the end I was really done.
Over the whole 22.53km segment, I averaged a 8:11min/km pace. If the heart rate sensor is somewhat accurate, for the last 1/5th of the segment I was constantly over 150 up to 160 bpm towards the end. This run also was, unsurprisingly, my &amp;ldquo;personal best&amp;rdquo; at a half-marathon distance, with it being the only run at this distance so far, with a time of 2:52:42 for the 21.1km distance. Seeing that time and knowing how I felt at the end of it, I am still very worried about achieving that average pace of 7:35 min/km, which the garmin coach tool is very confident in me making that. During the last 5km of the run, I felt my back hurting and noticed that I was running a bit hunched over, should look to stick to a more upright form.&lt;br>
Today is Sunday and I feel that run in my legs and knees. Not hurting, but a bit of soreness, I guess.&lt;br>
I actually ran a half-marathon and in a time that would land me under the 3hour cut-off time which seems to be common at races. I have to say that I ran it on a very flat course, but still, I did the distance. Even if I don&amp;rsquo;t achieve the goal pace that is set for the training plan, which was the slowest &amp;ldquo;time goal&amp;rdquo; I could set as I explained &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-start/">at the start of this training plan&lt;/a>, my personal goal was just to be able to actually run a half-marathon at the end of this training plan, finishing in the set time of 2hours40min is more of a bonus for me now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For what to do after this training plan, I am considering getting some help of a coach, probably online, because I looked near me and couldn&amp;rsquo;t really find one, to help me set goals and map out a long-term training plan for the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total distance this week: 48.07km&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wednesday (30th of September): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (1st of October): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday (2nd of October): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (3rd of October): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All the runs were back to back this week. As I wrote in the previous post, I did the Tired Run which is normally scheduled for Monday already on Sunday.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 2:00 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 2:00 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Interval time going up again, which is nice.
Distance: 6.79km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance:6.66km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="friday-run">Friday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 5.13km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 17.70km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I was feeling really good on this run and took a bit of a longer way, which took me 2km over the distance and only 1.3km short of the whole half marathon distance.
Distance: 19.88km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total distance for this week was 38.47km and the total distance for September was 148.72km, about 1km more than last month. I am amazed at this number, because I (probably said this before) wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have believed that I was capable of doing this when you wouldve asked me at the start of this year. I wouldve been exhausted after a few kms, because I had no idea of what it means to have an easy pace. But this is what makes me want to see how far I can take this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you next week.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (21st of September): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday (22nd of September): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (23rd of September): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday (25th of September): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (26th of September): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday (27th of September): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I had a bit more time on my hands this week and the next, for that reason i switched the plan to have 5 instead of 4 runs a week.
Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I had time on Monday, the normal day for the &amp;ldquo;Tired Run&amp;rdquo; in the coming week, I did that today on Sunday, just to be sure to get it in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The distance for the Tired Runs went down compared to last week, but I assume that&amp;rsquo;s because this week has a run more scheduled.
Distance: 6.84km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 1:30 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 1:30 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Intervals also got shorter again :(.
Distance: 5.32km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 6.83km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="friday-run">Friday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 6.84km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 16.09km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are back up to 16.09km for the long run this week.
Distance: 16.46km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sunday-run">Sunday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Having the Tired Run actually on the day after the Long Run made me feel &amp;ldquo;tired&amp;rdquo; in my legs for the first time on one of these runs. The run from the previous day was still noticeable in my legs. But nothing to worry about, after I was about 1km into it, I felt good.&lt;br>
Distance: 8.46km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was a total distance of 50.74km. With this including originally 5 runs plus 1 from the coming week, I guess that this will be the top end for weekly mileage for this plan. But with this &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; pace, I felt no problem doing the runs. But I am still very worried about actually getting making the goal time of this training plan with 2:40.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am enjoying running a lot, the runs are some &amp;ldquo;me-time&amp;rdquo;, whether I am just thinking or listening to an audiobook (seriously a problem, might need to join audible or something). I like reading, but the runs also give me some time to get to some books that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to read so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also started thinking about what I want to do once I am done with this training plan. I don&amp;rsquo;t run to win a race or something, more to get fit/healthy, but I really enjoy the long runs. I could see me setting a very long-time goal, far in the distance, as in 2 years or more out, to try to complete an Ultra Marathon. Just to see what is possible for me to achieve. But for this, I feel like jumping from one 12-16 week training plan to the next, is not the right way to do it. But this is still just a thought, I will thinking about what to do from November on, when this plan is done, in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (14th of September): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday (15th of September): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (19th of September): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There was an Easy Run originally scheduled for Thursday, but I was sick from Wednesday till Friday and on Friday forgot to reschedule it to Sunday. Once the day that a run is scheduled on has passed, you cannot reschedule it on these Garmin Training Plans. I tried to reset it by changing the settings of the plan, but that did not work. Instead it made the Long Run from initially bein a 16.09km run into a 12.87km run.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Distance: 8.35km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 2 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 2 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I like the longer intervals, makes it much easier to find the right pace.
Distance: 6.60km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 12.87km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As I wrote above, by trying to mess with the training plan settings, it changed the long run to 12.87km instead of 16.09km.
I just tried to run the distance it was supposed to be.
Distance: 16.12km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In total I covered 31.16km this week, which would have been near 38 with the missed 6.44km run.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday (8th of September): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (9th of September): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (10th of September): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (12th of September): Long Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I had to reschedule the Tired Run from Monday to Wednesday this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 repeats:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run: 1:30 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 1:30 min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Last weeks speed repeats were 7x 1min, this week we moved up to 6x 1:30min. Still no idea why this specific speed is picked. I did a little bit better with getting the pace window correct during the interval, but still was off some of the time. Total distance was 5.30km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As I said above, this was initially scheduled for monday, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t free up enough time on that day.
Distance: 6.82km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same route as Wednesday.
Distance: 6.83km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 16.09km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We are back up to 16.09km for the long run this week. I felt pretty good on this one.
Distance: 16.71km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total distance for this week was 35.66km, longest so far.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (31st of August): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday (1st of September): Speed Repeats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (3rd of September): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (5th of September): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, speed workouts are here. Weirdly the plan showed me a video about hill repeats instead of speed repeats.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I gonna stop wondering why it is on Monday. This was the longest &amp;ldquo;non long run&amp;rdquo; so far.
Distance: 8.35km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>7 repeats:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 1 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recover: 1min | Jog or walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I had actually trouble getting the pace right in that 1 minute. The pace update on the watch felt too slow and for most intervals I got the pace right just before the interval ended. Otherwise felt good doing something other than easy runs.&lt;br>
Distance: 5.08km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same old.&lt;br>
Distance: 5.58km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 12.87km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This weeks long run was again a step back to last weeks. I now just assume that this is wanted. I got through it surprisingly good.
Distance: 13.71km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weeks total distance was 32.71km. So the weekly distance stayed the same as last week, that might explain because there was a step back in the long run.&lt;br>
Monday was also the last run of August. All runs of August add up to a total distance of 133.13km, which just as a number seems insane to me. I am proud of me for actually going through with this. This is also the half-way point of this training plan. While I just said that I am proud of my progress, I still feel like I am nowhere on track of actually making my goal of running a half-marathon in 2 hours 40 minutes, which is a 7:35min/km pace. The Garmin Coach algorithm is, contrary to me very positive about me progress. They have a gauge for how confident the algorithm is for you being on your way to make your goal time, for me it displays:&lt;br>
Extremely Confident: You’re exceeding plan expectations and may be capable of taking on a more challenging goal.&lt;br>
I haven&amp;rsquo;t run a single second at that target pace, but I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First half done, onto the next one, see you next week.&lt;/p>

Find out here what happened!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (24th of August): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (26th of August): Time Trial&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (27th of August): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (29nd of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At the start of this week, I only saw the &amp;ldquo;Tired Run&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Time Trial&amp;rdquo;, not yet the other runs. My guess was that the &amp;ldquo;Time Trial&amp;rdquo; will maybe adjust the easy pace or introduce a new run type.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Tired Run was again set to be on a Monday, when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t tired anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t get the logic behind what.
Distance: 5.22km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 0.8km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 1.61km | Time Trial | Give your best effort&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 0.8km | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Time Trial! Instead of the normal 2 min warm up and cool down, they actually used a distance here, which was new.
The actual distance for the time trial equals to a mile. I set 2 new &amp;ldquo;personal records&amp;rdquo; in this time trial.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1k in 5:55min&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1mi in 9:43min&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Yay me.&lt;br>
I ran for 3.69km that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Well, the given pace window is still the same, so the time trial didn&amp;rsquo;t change that.
Distance: 6.85km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 16.09km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A new long run distance today. Previous longest run was &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-5-weekly-update-10/">2 weeks ago&lt;/a>, which was 3.2km/2miles less than this run. I ran a totally new route today, which had an uphill section that was steeper than i thought, had to slow down there. It also rained on Friday, which made a short passage of a field way very slippery. Other than that, I got on fine, but felt like I was done around the 15km mark.
Total run time was 2 hours 30 minutes, for this I took an oat based energy bar with me. I never really tried to eat while running before, so this was new. I had no &amp;ldquo;stomach troubles&amp;rdquo; with it, just eating it while running was weird.
Total distance for this run: 16.84km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This brings this weeks total to 32.6km/20.26miles, which is the longest distance I have covered in a week so far.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (17th of August): Tired Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday (18th of August): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (20th of August): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (22nd of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same pattern of runs as last week. Hoping for some mix up soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I kept this run on monday, since this seem to be what the plan wants. I honestly did not feel tired at all and tried to stay near the same pace as the other easy runs for a total distance of 6.82km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 3.22km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I assume since the Monday run was longer, it turned down the Tuesday run a bit. An easy run over 3.55km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Not much to say about it.
Distance: 5.20km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The long run went back to the 9.65 distance this week. Maybe because I rated &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-5-weekly-update-10/">last weeks&lt;/a> long run as &amp;ldquo;Hard&amp;rdquo;, but who knows. No struggles here, for 10.05km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This brings this weeks total distance to 25.62km/15.92miles, around the same as 2 weeks ago. So a step back in distance. I am wondering if this is just normal for the plan or a reaction to last weeks long run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is 6 weeks done and 10 to go in this plan.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Tuesday (11th of August): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (13th of August): Easy Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (15th of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Compared to the last 4 weeks, not all workouts were titled as &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo; this week, only Saturdays long run stuck with that.
The &amp;ldquo;Tired Run&amp;rdquo; is supposed to be a recovery run, being the run after the long run. It gives you the following description in the workout notes: &amp;ldquo;Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Which in my eyes could also be interpreted as &amp;ldquo;go all out if you can&amp;rdquo;, but what i could understand is that you still should go &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; and it is there to simulate later stages of a race, just that I found that out after the run.&lt;br>
The &amp;ldquo;Easy Run&amp;rdquo; is just the same es the normal &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo; the weeks before, same pace window and all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | Give your best effort on tired legs. Don’t overdo it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t yet understand the any of the pacing, I just ran without looking at my watch and ran the &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo; part in a 7:58min/km pace.
Overall I ran 5.24km on Monday.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The second run of the week moved to Tuesday from Wednesday. Otherwise it was the same old.
Distance: 5.22km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 6.44km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So the midweek runs also start stepping up in distance!&lt;br>
Distance: 6.99km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 12.87km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After being at 9.65km long runs for 3 weeks in a row, I had a 3.21km / 2 Miles step up this week. I struggled this run. I still got in a slightly faster average pace than the give pace window with 8:29min/km, but I started to fast and had to take a slow walk towards the end. the run took almost 2 hours, I started early, but once the sun was up and I was over 10km run I was struggling. Still happy I got it done, but I need to pay more attention to my pace in the future. I rated this run as &amp;ldquo;Hard&amp;rdquo; because I had to walk for a short while. With these runs going near the 2 hour mark, I feel like I should start thinking about getting some carbs in. So far I have only taken a bottle filled with water and an electrolyte tablet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Distance: 13.37km&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weekly distance overall was 30.82km/19.15miles, which is more than a 5km step up from last week. This weeks &amp;ldquo;Tired Run&amp;rdquo; was on Monday, which I assumed happened because I blocked Sunday off as a no run day. But I actually took that setting out to see what happens for next weeks plan and the Tired Run is still in Mondays. Weird. Is that supposed to be this way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to come back next week!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (3rd of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (5th of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (6th of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (8th of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same old, distance: 5.2km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.02km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wednesday was again the shortest run of the week.
Distance: 4.39&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Again same distance as last week, different route this time for a total of 5.82km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The same long run distance now for 3 weeks in a row. Either it wants me to get more accustomed with the distance before moving up, or this is a reaction of me &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; during &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-3-weekly-update-8/">last week&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
Distance for this run was 10.07km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weekly distance was 25.48km / 15.83 miles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This completes the first quarter of this training plan. I read only that after a few weeks it should start also offering hill/speed repeats, but no luck so far. I can see next weeks workouts, which slightly changed from just being described as a &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo;, but that is all. I hope it offers some kind of other workout soon, because I enjoyed them during my 5k training plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading, come back next week!&lt;/p>

This week I also wore the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 for all runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (27th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (29th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (30th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (1st of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Somepoint last week, Garmins Server for all the online/sync stuff went down and still were on Monday. I still had the workout on the watch, but after it syncing worked again and it got uploaded, it didn&amp;rsquo;t register as the run that I should&amp;rsquo;ve done for the plan, so the plan assumes I missed 1 run this week.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to me, because I know I did the workout.&lt;br>
It just felt really weird how Garmins Connect App/Web Service works. Basically nothing is done on your Smartphone, you could not sync from smartphone to watch or reverse without a connection to the Garmin Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall distance: 5.14km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 3.22km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nice short run. Distance: 4.35km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same as Monday length as Monday with a distance of 5.11km this time&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This weeks Long Run was the same distance as last weeks, on this day I ran a total of 10.27km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekly distance was therefore around 24.87km / 15,45 miles, which is a little bit less than a mile more than last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shoe">Shoe&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said above, I wore the new Gaviota 2 for every run this week. They feel just right. Nothing more or less to add, very happy with that purchase!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This was an easy effort over 4.46km. I still have a hard time keeping the same pace. The Garmin Forerunner 245 shows you the &amp;ldquo;pace window&amp;rdquo; that you should stay in but it kept beeping and vibrating because at the beginning of the run I was running faster than 8:31 min/km.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last weeks Long Run was over 8.05km / 5 Miles, this week was a step up of a Mile to 9.65km / 6 Miles which is my newest farthest distance. The complete distance for this run was exactly 10.00km. I rated this as a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; workout, because at the end of this run is was done. With this I also set a new Personal Record for the 10k distance with it being my only run to reach 10k so far with 1h28min09s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this whole week I had a distance of 23.34km / 14.5 Miles. So I ran the half-marathon, just stretched out over the week. I am pretty happy with this week. Looking forward to running more!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoka-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoka One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My pair of the Gaviota 2 (EU Size 44, Wide) arrived and I did the Thursday run in them. There is a huge difference to my Asics Gel-Fortitude 8, it just feels so much softer, in a good way. The upper material fits nicely without constricting my fat mid-foot. The soft cushioning will definitely help protecting my knees from the impact, especially on the longer runs in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t really have much more to say. See you next week!&lt;/p>

And I tried some new shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-start/">I started on this plan on Tuesday&lt;/a> this week had only 3 workouts in it and they were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday (14th): Benchmark Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (16th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (18th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Details for my Benchmark Run can be found on my last post linked above (or on the bottom of this posts).&lt;br>
After the Benchmark Run was done, the runs for the rest of the week were generated and a short video about the importance of easy runs and rest days. Which didn&amp;rsquo;t offer anything new to me, but I assume that is the standard video that also appears on all other of Coach Amys plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The plan seems to have settled on 8:31 to 8:50 min/km pace as my &amp;ldquo;easy run pace&amp;rdquo;. Which is probably super slow for everyone else, but feels good to me.
I finished the run segment with an average pace of 8:34 min/km. After every run you have to give your run an difficulty rating from the following choices:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moderate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very Hard (at least I think that&amp;rsquo;s what it was)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since this run was nice and easy, that&amp;rsquo;s what I rated it as, easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saturday-long-run">Saturday Long Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was probably my longest run so far. I actually made use of garmins route/navigation feature for this run. I planned a route in the Garmin Connect Route Planner, synced it to my watch and selected it during my run. A short distance before every direction change, the watch vibrated and displayed a little arrow to show which direction to continue on. Liked this feature a lot, this way I can stray away from my usual route, without having to keep the whole course in my mind. This is also the first run that I took something to drink with me. For that I used the CAMELBAK Quick Grip Chill Handheld Water Bottle, which is an insulated plastic bottle with a volume of 620ml / 21oz, which has a detachable handgrip with a small bag that fits a phone, id and keys for example. I filled it with water and to be sure an electrolyte tablet, I am a heavy sweater after all. The run itself was ok but i struggled at the end, the legs got heavy.&lt;br>
I had an average pace of 8:35 min/km, so well within the range I should be in. Because I struggled for the last 1.5km I rated it as a moderate difficulty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These 3 runs put me at a total distance of 17.98km for this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoke-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoke One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A friend of mine has these shoes in a similar size to mine. They are stability shoes, which was something new to me in a runnign shoe. He had them also in wide and they supposedly are the stability equivalent to the Hoka&amp;rsquo;s Bondi line, which I can&amp;rsquo;t find in wide, but was told to try. The whole stability thing didn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way at all, they felt great on a short run I did, and you can feel the difference in cushioning to my shoes. Long Story Short, I ordered a pair for myself. Hoke One One even offers to take them back after you have taken them to the streets in a 30 day period, which is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week is going to be for the full 4 runs that I set the training plan to for now. Till then!&lt;/p>

I had my first Benchmark run today for this plan and also got the New Balance 1080v10s that I ordered today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the Training Plan first, I kind of just leaned towards the Garmin Coach Training Plan because it kind of takes all the thinking out of it for me (at least I hope it does). It claims to adjusts to your performance to help you reach your goal and also has all the workouts send to my Garmin Forerunner 245 watch, so that i basically just have to press start and can go. You can also have it connect to your online calendars and see all your runs there, which is nice if you want it, I don&amp;rsquo;t use it (for now).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you start to set up your training plan, you get an overview of the 3 coaches available. Each coach has a short introduction video where they explain their methods. There is a nice blogpost over on &lt;a href="https://www.myrunnerslife.com/garmin-coach/garmin-coach-which-coach-do-you-choose/">MyRunnersLife&lt;/a> which gives an overview of all coaches if you are interested, also a view other posts about Garmin Coach. For my Half-Marathon training plan I chose Coach Amy Parkerson-Mitchell, she offered the length of the plan that I wanted (16 weeks) with 4 to 5 workouts per week. I think with Coach Greg McMillan, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the same length and Coach Jeff Galloway only had 3 workouts in a week (and I am not sold on the run/walk thing he talked about in the video). You can still switch them if you aren&amp;rsquo;t happy with the plan of one coach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have selected your coach, they have you enter some data for your plan. First is if you just want to finish your target distance or if you have are training to reach a specific time goal. I am honestly not doing this to reach any time goal, I had none in mind before starting this, but once given the option I opted to select the slowest selectable time goal, which is a half-marathon finish time of 2h40min, which is a 7:35 min/km pace. Not kidding, this seems far out of my reach, I&amp;rsquo;d be very happy just to be able to finish the half-marathon distance in a continuous run. But, knowing that I can still swap over the plan to a &amp;ldquo;just finish&amp;rdquo; section without a time goal, if I feel that I am totally out of my depth, I am going for this 2h40min time goal for now. I mean at some point I couldn&amp;rsquo;t jog for 500m and I have 16 weeks of time to try to get there. No reason not to try it.&lt;br>
Other data you need to provide is the number of workouts per week, which you can set to either 4 or 5 with Coach Amy. For now I have set it to 4.&lt;br>
Next comes your available days, which for me is always but sundays and you also have to select on which day you want to have your weekly Long Run on. For me this is Saturday.&lt;br>
And finally your &amp;ldquo;Race date&amp;rdquo; if you were training for a specific race. Since most(probably all) races are cancelled because of COVID-19 around my part of the world I just chose a Saturday 16 weeks out, which turned out to be the 31th of October.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After giving it all the data it wants, it gives you your first workout, which is a &amp;ldquo;Benchmark Run&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
Which was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 5 min | Run strong. Walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I did this today, I ran the 5min run part in a 6:35 min/km pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After syncing it back to my phone, the first week of workouts was generated, which I will give an overview of at the end of the week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said at the top, I also got 2 pairs of the New Balance 1080v10 EU Size 44, one in 2E and one in 4E widths. The 2Es were a bit too narrow on my midfoot, the 4Es fit like a glove. But, when I was just walking around, the material on top just felt to flimsy. The shoe is cut very low around the ankles and I just felt not &amp;ldquo;safe enough&amp;rdquo; in them. Now they are on their way back to New Balance.
I want to get my hands on a Bondi 6 in wide, which I was told is wider than the clifton 7 on the mid-foot, &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/weekly-update-5/">which didn&amp;rsquo;t fit my feet&lt;/a>, but they seem to be sold out everywhere in wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all for today, see you at the end of the week.&lt;/p>

Still hurt, still looking at half-marathon training plans and getting new shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of continuing rib pain, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a single run this week. Last night was the first night that I could actually sleep through again without waking up in pain because i rolled onto the wrong side. Still missing a lot of sleep, but hope to catch up soon. During the day today it barely hurt on the ribs when taking deep breaths, so looking good so far.&lt;br>
I will try my first run again as soon as it stops hurting while I breath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still am planning to start with a half-marathon training plan next but still haven&amp;rsquo;t decided which one. But if everything goes alright, I will have chosen one by next sunday and will start that on the following monday, at least that is the plan so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also ordered new shoes. So far I have been running in the Asics Gel-Fortitude 8 in 2E width and EU size 44. I have wide feet, which is a problem in Europe, because most sports stores only stock standard widths and some companies don&amp;rsquo;t even offer wide or extra-wide shoes in Europe, one of them being Saucony. For my next shoe, since I am trying to up my distance I wanted to go with a shoe that has a lot of cushioning.&lt;br>
After some research i ordered the Hoka One One Clifton 7 in 2E/wide. I got them this week, but while the toebox is huge, on the mid-foot it is just too narrow for me, I could put them on, but my foot spilled over a lot. After that I asked on the RunningShoeGeeks subreddit for some recommendations for my case. Mentioned were Altras, Brooks, Saucony Triumph and New Balance 1080v10. The Saucony Triumph would have been my first order, but I was told by their european customer service, that they only offer medium width shoes in europe. I ignored the Altras for now, because they are zero-drop, coming from a 10mm drop shoe seems a bit much of a change, especially when I will still be switching between my old and new pair of shoes. I now ordered the New Balance 1080v10 in both 2E and 4E, getting them on Tuesday. I hope on of those is a good fit. Shoe shopping has always been a pain in the ass for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for now, thanks for taking your time to read this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5k Plan: (Final) Week 8</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 23:46:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Weekly Update #4&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the last week of the 8 week 5k Plan I have been following. The good news, I got my 5k paced run done. The bad news, I am sick/hurt at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, here is the weekly overview:
&lt;img src="https://LiminalRunner.com/img/weekly/garmin2020-w27.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week27">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monday was a tempo run, going through multiple paces, nothing new but good fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did my &amp;ldquo;timed&amp;rdquo; 5k run on Thursday because I was not sure if I could get a run in on Friday or Saturday.&lt;br>
The &lt;a href="https://www.nike.com/pdf/Nike-Run-Club-5K-Training-Plan-Audio-Guided-Runs.pdf">Nike Run Club 5k Training plan&lt;/a> gives a whole table of paces for people in different states of fitness/ability. Because it has been a while since I ran i started this plan on the slowest level of their pace table.
That translates to&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th style="text-align:center">1k pace&lt;/th>
&lt;th style="text-align:center">5k pace&lt;/th>
&lt;th style="text-align:center">10k pace&lt;/th>
&lt;th style="text-align:center">recovery pace&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td style="text-align:center">7:30&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:center">7:55&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:center">8:10&lt;/td>
&lt;td style="text-align:center">9:00&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>This would translate to a 12:00 mile pace, you can do the rest of the math yourselves. :)&lt;br>
Following this pace, this would set me up with a 39:30 5k time. I am aware that this is super slow. But I am just competing against myself and not against others. For me this is about finishing it and having fun doing it. Getting faster is something that will come with time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the run itself I did about an 800m warmup followed by a few minutes of dynamic stretches. In the last weeks I always felt sluggish on my long runs without having a proper warmup because i thought that at an easy recovery speed I don&amp;rsquo;t need one (the training plan also didn&amp;rsquo;t mention one, but does in interval/tempo/fartlek/hill workouts). With this warmup I was ready to go, no sluggish feeling!&lt;br>
Just for the hell of it I did it without looking at my watch to get a gps pace estimate.&lt;br>
Keep in mind the table above with the paces I was going for, here are the &amp;ldquo;personal records&amp;rdquo; I set this run:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://LiminalRunner.com/img/weekly/garmin2020-w27pr.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week27pr">&lt;br>
The first km was the 6:37min/km time, up till the 3k mark, i continued running below 7:00 min/km. Around the 3k mark I had to slow down to a slow jog for a around 20 seconds to get my breathing under control. I finished running an 7:10 min/km average for the whole distance, which means I was 4min faster than the pace I was aiming for. On one side, I now know that I can run a 5k faster than the target pace I set for myself which sounds good, on the other side, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pace myself at all. As I said, after 3k my breathing was all over the place. This is something I am not happy about. I guess if i kept the pace at around 7:15 min/km I could&amp;rsquo;ve run the whole 5k still struggling, but without slowing down or have my breathing go out of control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Friday was an easy recovery run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that&amp;rsquo;s also when I started feeling a pain in my ribs. I had a slightly annoying feeling in my ribs since monday morning, when stretching after waking up. Which i thought was just me having slept in a weird position or something similar and I only felt it when I fully extended my arms which put a lot of pressure in my ribcage.&lt;br>
At the end of the friday run, I had pain on the right side my ribcage while taking deep breaths which later throughout the day also happened on any major movement like sitting down/getting up or lifting something heavy enough for the muscles near the area to engange. After a visit to my GP, I ended up with the diagnosis of it being an inflammation, possibly from some viral infection and a prescription for some pain killers.&lt;br>
Which led to me finding out that ibuprofen doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to do a good job for me on this, because as someone who usually falls asleep while lying on my side, that was impossible. I missed a lot of sleep the last 2 days and I have been in pain. No running at the moment. I hope that this will be gone in a few days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is my 5k training plan done and now I have little bit of time to look for what to do next. I mentioned it in a previous post already, I am looking for a longer distance training plan, especially for a half marathon, which seems to be still managable timewise. I have looked at a few, nothing set in stone yet, might continue with the Nike HM plan, or maybe I might give the Garmin Coach Half Marathon feature which you have access to if you have a garmin watch a try, at least for a week or two to see what it will look like, since it seems to adapt itself to your performance. But I am meanwhile also looking at other plans, tons of them out there on the net.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this week, thanks for reading. Hope to see you again!.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5k Plan: Week 7</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week7/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 20:18:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week7/</guid><description>&lt;p>Weekly Update #3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another week gone by. Some unexpected things came up and I only got to do 3 runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://LiminalRunner.com/img/weekly/garmin2020-w26.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week26">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monday was a hill interval workout at different speeds, a first for me. I was on a road that according to google maps should have around 6-7% inclination through a vineyard. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind going uphill at all, but the fact that I had to go back down just to get up again between every interval was slightly annoying. I don&amp;rsquo;t like walking or running downhill in general.&lt;br>
Wednesday were flat intervals. I am learning that I really do enjoy intervals.&lt;br>
Friday was long run day with a 5k. Had the same problem as last week, that the first 1 or 2 km it just felt sluggish and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into a comfortable pace. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what the problem is there, they were both run at an easy pace but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel good at the start. Maybe I need to do some warmup or something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coming week is the last of this 5k training plan and I am thinking about what to do after I am done with this plan. I know that I am not fast at all, but haven&amp;rsquo;t run 5k at an not easy pace, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what my time could be. So going for a faster 5k time could be something to work on. But I feel more drawn to increasing the distance. The 5k training plan I am using now is from Nike and offers Audio Guided Runs for every run, which I liked a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that they also offer this kind of plan for 10k, half marathon and marathon. I am thinking about aiming for that half marathon distance. Going from 5k to 21.1k is a lot not just the distance but also the time commitment. Long run days will take hours of my time, which is something I&amp;rsquo;ll have to consider. I&amp;rsquo;ll also have to think about hydration and/or nutrition. I never carried anything with me so far, because I knew I would be back home within an hour at the longest. I&amp;rsquo;ll also look into half marathon training plans that are available on the internet to see how they differ from the Nike one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is all, till next week.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5k Plan: Week 6</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:12:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week6/</guid><description>&lt;p>Weekly Update #2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was week 25 of 2020 and week 6 of the 5k Training Plan I am following.&lt;br>
Here are the stats from my watch, since it already flipped over to monday, the 7 day overview left out last monday, the 15th:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://LiminalRunner.com/img/weekly/garmin2020-w25.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week25">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only had time to do 4 runs this week.&lt;br>
The missing Monday was an interval workout, Wednesday was a tempo run and the long run, which I did on Friday this week was for 6.5km / 4 Miles ( which ended up being 6.95km). Since these long runs are supposed to be run at an easy pace, the length itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem at all. But the first 1-2km I had real problems finding that easy pace, but at around 2k I settled into a comfortable pace which i held (with small variations) to the end without much of a problem. Pretty happe with this weeks progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next weeks workouts include an interval run on a hill. The hills here go all over the place with inclination, so I am just going pick one and will keep going up that one. That workout will probably be hard on me, since the runs I always do are pretty much flat with only a small net elevation change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you next post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5k Plan: Week 5</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 23:50:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/5k-week5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Weekly Update #1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is week 24 of 2020 and today I finished week 5 of the Nike 5k Training Plan I am following.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the stats from my Garmin watch:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://LiminalRunner.com/img/weekly/garmin2020-w24.jpg" alt="weekly_stats_2020_week24">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see I managed to go on 5 runs, as per the training plan those were 2 tempo/interval runs, 2 recovery runs and 1 long run. The interval run on Tuesday was slightly longer than the actual long run, but thats to be expected on these &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; distances I guess.&lt;br>
I am pretty happy with how this week went down, weather was around 15-22°C for most of the week, just about right for me, but windy and rainy on 2 of the days. The only thing that felt off was the pacing, I went all over the place. Not sure if I somehow get influenced by the music I am listening to while the Audio Guides are silent or if I just suck at sticking to a pace in general, but that&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to work on, other than me being slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week the planend long run is for 6.5km or 4 Miles which is around the distance I ran before I stopped running over a year ago.&lt;br>
The tempo/interval runs in this training plan all have a 5 min warmup followed by optional stretching before the speed part which I&amp;rsquo;ve used to do some quick stretches which I remember from soccer practice almost 2 decades ago. I should look into what things to do for warmup, including for long and recovery runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all so far. Thank for reading this post. See you next Sunday (or maybe earlier).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/helloworld/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 20:51:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/helloworld/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there stranger,&lt;br>
for whatever reason you are reading this, thank you for visiting this website.
This page will serve as a journal for my &lt;strong>running&lt;/strong> activities and maybe also keep me accountable to keep going.
At this point I am in week 5 of the &lt;a href="https://www.nike.com/pdf/Nike-Run-Club-5K-Training-Plan-Audio-Guided-Runs.pdf">Nike Run Club 5k Training plan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have an &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/about/">about&lt;/a> page with a some information about me if you are interested.
At this point I am super slow, but hopefully that will change in the future.
For now I plan to post updates at the end of every week, but that might also change, who knows!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>about</title><link>https://LiminalRunner.com/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:44:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://LiminalRunner.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to my about page.
I am 34 years old (as of 2020). In spring of 2018 I did c25k to help with losing weight, because my diet was stalling. I completed that and continued to run for a few months but an injury stopped me from running for a while and after that I did not pick it up again, because I had zero fun doing it. A major reason for that was that I had no real concept of an &lt;strong>easy pace&lt;/strong> and was doing these 5k runs heaving for air all the way. I basically didn&amp;rsquo;t pick running up again.&lt;br>
That is until this year. I basically started again from zero (not that I was anywhere &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; before) and this time decided to use a 5k Training Plan i found on the Nike website, which is based on the Audio Guided Runs in their Nike Run Club app, which I think is a neat thing and works for me.&lt;br>
Running gets me to move, which I don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of the rest of the day. At the moment I am still following this 5k Training Plan and if the weather doesn&amp;rsquo;t interfere with storms and heavy rain, I plan to run 4 to 5 times per week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I am slow, but everyone has to start at some point, very slow is just that starting point for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any particular time/pace/distance goal in mind, but at some point running a marathon (if I can commit enough time to actually train for one) in the far future would be nice. But so far I am having fun and am taking it &lt;strong>easy&lt;/strong>, going step by step, hence the name of this page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This page will serve as a journal for my running activities and maybe also keep me accountable to not just stop it again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
