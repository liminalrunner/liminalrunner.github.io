<p>Yesterday I felt better and thought why not jump right into the Garmin Coach Training plan that I have been reading up on quite a bit.
I had my first Benchmark run today for this plan and also got the New Balance 1080v10s that I ordered today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the Training Plan first, I kind of just leaned towards the Garmin Coach Training Plan because it kind of takes all the thinking out of it for me (at least I hope it does). It claims to adjusts to your performance to help you reach your goal and also has all the workouts send to my Garmin Forerunner 245 watch, so that i basically just have to press start and can go. You can also have it connect to your online calendars and see all your runs there, which is nice if you want it, I don&rsquo;t use it (for now).</p>
<p>When you start to set up your training plan, you get an overview of the 3 coaches available. Each coach has a short introduction video where they explain their methods. There is a nice blogpost over on <a href=https://www.myrunnerslife.com/garmin-coach/garmin-coach-which-coach-do-you-choose/>MyRunnersLife</a> which gives an overview of all coaches if you are interested, also a view other posts about Garmin Coach. For my Half-Marathon training plan I chose Coach Amy Parkerson-Mitchell, she offered the length of the plan that I wanted (16 weeks) with 4 to 5 workouts per week. I think with Coach Greg McMillan, I couldn&rsquo;t get the same length and Coach Jeff Galloway only had 3 workouts in a week (and I am not sold on the run/walk thing he talked about in the video). You can still switch them if you aren&rsquo;t happy with the plan of one coach.</p>
<p>Once you have selected your coach, they have you enter some data for your plan. First is if you just want to finish your target distance or if you have are training to reach a specific time goal. I am honestly not doing this to reach any time goal, I had none in mind before starting this, but once given the option I opted to select the slowest selectable time goal, which is a half-marathon finish time of 2h40min, which is a 7:35 min/km pace. Not kidding, this seems far out of my reach, I&rsquo;d be very happy just to be able to finish the half-marathon distance in a continuous run. But, knowing that I can still swap over the plan to a &ldquo;just finish&rdquo; section without a time goal, if I feel that I am totally out of my depth, I am going for this 2h40min time goal for now. I mean at some point I couldn&rsquo;t jog for 500m and I have 16 weeks of time to try to get there. No reason not to try it.<br>
Other data you need to provide is the number of workouts per week, which you can set to either 4 or 5 with Coach Amy. For now I have set it to 4.<br>
Next comes your available days, which for me is always but sundays and you also have to select on which day you want to have your weekly Long Run on. For me this is Saturday.<br>
And finally your &ldquo;Race date&rdquo; if you were training for a specific race. Since most(probably all) races are cancelled because of COVID-19 around my part of the world I just chose a Saturday 16 weeks out, which turned out to be the 31th of October.</p>
<p>After giving it all the data it wants, it gives you your first workout, which is a &ldquo;Benchmark Run&rdquo;.<br>
Which was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly</li>
<li>Run: 5 min | Run strong. Walk if you need to.</li>
<li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did this today, I ran the 5min run part in a 6:35 min/km pace.</p>
<p>After syncing it back to my phone, the first week of workouts was generated, which I will give an overview of at the end of the week.</p>
<p>As I said at the top, I also got 2 pairs of the New Balance 1080v10 EU Size 44, one in 2E and one in 4E widths. The 2Es were a bit too narrow on my midfoot, the 4Es fit like a glove. But, when I was just walking around, the material on top just felt to flimsy. The shoe is cut very low around the ankles and I just felt not &ldquo;safe enough&rdquo; in them. Now they are on their way back to New Balance.
I want to get my hands on a Bondi 6 in wide, which I was told is wider than the clifton 7 on the mid-foot, <a href=/posts/weekly-update-5/>which didn&rsquo;t fit my feet</a>, but they seem to be sold out everywhere in wide.</p>
<p>This is all for today, see you at the end of the week.</p>
