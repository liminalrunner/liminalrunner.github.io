<p>Done with my first half-marathon plan!</p>
<p>This weeks runs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday (28th of October): Speed Repeats</li>
<li>Friday (30th of October): Final Long Run</li>
</ul>
<p>Only 2 runs counting towards this week, because I already did the Tired Run that was usually on Monday, on <a href=/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-15-weekly-update-20/>Sunday last week</a>.<br>
The last run was first planned for Saturday, as almost every Long Run i did so far, but on Friday, after 2 days of rain the weather opened up and I could free up some time.</p>
<h3 id=wednesday-run>Wednesday Run</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warm up: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly</li>
<li>10 repeats:
<ul>
<li>Run: 0:30 min | 6:58 to 7:16 min/km | Run hard!</li>
<li>Recover: 0:30 min | Jog or walk if you need to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cool down: 1.61km | Walk or jog lightly</li>
</ul>
<p>For this final speed repeat workout, the intervals got even shorter. Hitting a certain pace window in this short interval is just something that feels really hard to do for me.
Distance: 4.61km</p>
<h3 id=friday-run>Friday Run</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run: 21.10 km</li>
</ul>
<p>The final run, that I have been looking forward to, but also was anxious to see if i really could hit the target pace of 7:35 min/km to hit that 2h40min goal time. I achieved that, with an asterisk.<br>
The path I was running is a mix of gravel and concrete and I was going for an out and back run. The path has multiple smaller streams crossing it, which are easily navigated through by using bigger stones in it or a small wooden path over it, for which I would&rsquo;ve just slowed down, if they would&rsquo;ve been wet. What I did not anticipate was that there was so much water, that the streams were flooding the way and covering the stones completely. I had to backtrack and find a way were I can jump/cross it safely. For that I stopped my the timer on my watch.<br>
It being autumn and having rained for the last 2 days, the path was covered in a ton of wet leaves. Which wasn&rsquo;t a problem till around 17km in i slipped and landed on my ass. Had to walk for under a minute after that but got running again to finish it up.
There were also some muddy areas from someone driving around with a tractor or some other farming equipment, which I had to slow down a bit for.
Overall, my running time was 2h38min50sec, all included other than me looking how to cross the streams. That averages to 7:32min/km. I was just below my target pace/goal time, which I am very happy with.</p>
<p>What I noticed was that stamina wasn&rsquo;t the problem, but in my knees I was feeling the load starting to stack up about 2/3rds of the way in and it kept building up. They were done after the run and 2 days after that. My lower back also started hurting a bit around the same time, because my form got sloppy and I sturted to hunch my back, which I do way to often during my day behind my desk.</p>
<p>I actually reached to new personal bests with this run, obviously the half-marathon, but also the 10K with a 1h13min12sec.</p>
<p>Weekly distance was 25.71km.</p>
<p>I am planning on writing a final review of my experience with this Garmin Coach Half-Marathon Training plan in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>About <a href=/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-week-13-weekly-update-18/>3 weeks ago</a>, I wrote that I was thinking about getting a &ldquo;real&rdquo; coach. I was looking for someone who is both an experienced runner and maybe has some sort of scientific background. I don&rsquo;t care to much to &ldquo;push my 5k/10k time&rdquo; to a certain finish time and compare myself to others, because that train has sailed a long time ago, I am starting at age 34 and also, I enjoyed pushing the distance and challenging myself that way. So the coach should also be someone more distance oriented. And lastly also someone affordable. At this point I cannot justify spending 200$ or more a month for coaching. I just want to make clear, that I am not saying that it could not be worth that much.<br>
For the long term, and I mean more like (a) year(s) and not weeks or months, I&rsquo;ve set my sight on working towards an ultra marathon. Which is a scary thing to do from my perspective, because I am both overweight and my general fitness isn&rsquo;t good, but I enjoy the challenge of distance far more than I enjoy the challenge of speed, if that makes sense. And for that I want a coach, because I want to get there as injury free and healthy as possible and just jumping from one training plan (that is usually aimed at the &ldquo;average person&rdquo;) to the next might work for most people, but for me I want someone I can talk to to make adjustments and help me reach that far fetched goal in a healthy way.<br>
I looked around the internet and got in touch and had a call with one during this week. I was very happy with our conversation and I am looking forward to working with that Coach. For the coming weeks, we agreed to just get me adjusted to the coaches training style, without working towards a goal other than improving my general fitness.</p>
<p>Posts here may be a bit less frequent till the end of the year, but I will keep posting about my progress and as I meantioned above, there will be a review of the Garmin Coach plan coming.</p>
