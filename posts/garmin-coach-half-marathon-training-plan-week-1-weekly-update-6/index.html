<p>First week of the Garmin Coach Half-Marathon Training Plan with Coach Amy is done!<br>
And I tried some new shoes.</p>
<p>Because <a href=/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-start/>I started on this plan on Tuesday</a> this week had only 3 workouts in it and they were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday (14th): Benchmark Run</li>
<li>Thursday (16th): Run</li>
<li>Saturday (18th): Run</li>
</ul>
<p>Details for my Benchmark Run can be found on my last post linked above (or on the bottom of this posts).<br>
After the Benchmark Run was done, the runs for the rest of the week were generated and a short video about the importance of easy runs and rest days. Which didn&rsquo;t offer anything new to me, but I assume that is the standard video that also appears on all other of Coach Amys plans.</p>
<h2 id=thursday-run>Thursday Run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly</li>
<li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km</li>
<li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan seems to have settled on 8:31 to 8:50 min/km pace as my &ldquo;easy run pace&rdquo;. Which is probably super slow for everyone else, but feels good to me.
I finished the run segment with an average pace of 8:34 min/km. After every run you have to give your run an difficulty rating from the following choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very Easy</li>
<li>Easy</li>
<li>Moderate</li>
<li>Hard</li>
<li>Very Hard (at least I think that&rsquo;s what it was)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this run was nice and easy, that&rsquo;s what I rated it as, easy.</p>
<h2 id=saturday-long-run>Saturday Long Run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly</li>
<li>Run: 8.05km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km</li>
<li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly</li>
</ul>
<p>This was probably my longest run so far. I actually made use of garmins route/navigation feature for this run. I planned a route in the Garmin Connect Route Planner, synced it to my watch and selected it during my run. A short distance before every direction change, the watch vibrated and displayed a little arrow to show which direction to continue on. Liked this feature a lot, this way I can stray away from my usual route, without having to keep the whole course in my mind. This is also the first run that I took something to drink with me. For that I used the CAMELBAK Quick Grip Chill Handheld Water Bottle, which is an insulated plastic bottle with a volume of 620ml / 21oz, which has a detachable handgrip with a small bag that fits a phone, id and keys for example. I filled it with water and to be sure an electrolyte tablet, I am a heavy sweater after all. The run itself was ok but i struggled at the end, the legs got heavy.<br>
I had an average pace of 8:35 min/km, so well within the range I should be in. Because I struggled for the last 1.5km I rated it as a moderate difficulty.</p>
<p>These 3 runs put me at a total distance of 17.98km for this week.</p>
<h2 id=hoke-one-one-gaviota-2>Hoke One One Gaviota 2</h2>
<p>A friend of mine has these shoes in a similar size to mine. They are stability shoes, which was something new to me in a runnign shoe. He had them also in wide and they supposedly are the stability equivalent to the Hoka&rsquo;s Bondi line, which I can&rsquo;t find in wide, but was told to try. The whole stability thing didn&rsquo;t get in the way at all, they felt great on a short run I did, and you can feel the difference in cushioning to my shoes. Long Story Short, I ordered a pair for myself. Hoke One One even offers to take them back after you have taken them to the streets in a 30 day period, which is awesome.</p>
<p>Next week is going to be for the full 4 runs that I set the training plan to for now. Till then!</p>
