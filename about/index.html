<h1>about</h1>
<p>Welcome to my about page.
I am 34 years old (as of 2020). In spring of 2018 I did c25k to help with losing weight, because my diet was stalling. I completed that and continued to run for a few months but an injury stopped me from running for a while and after that I did not pick it up again, because I had zero fun doing it. A major reason for that was that I had no real concept of an <strong>easy pace</strong> and was doing these 5k runs heaving for air all the way. I basically didn&rsquo;t pick running up again.<br>
That is until this year. I basically started again from zero (not that I was anywhere &ldquo;fast&rdquo; before) and this time decided to use a 5k Training Plan i found on the Nike website, which is based on the Audio Guided Runs in their Nike Run Club app, which I think is a neat thing and works for me.<br>
Running gets me to move, which I don&rsquo;t do a lot of the rest of the day. At the moment I am still following this 5k Training Plan and if the weather doesn&rsquo;t interfere with storms and heavy rain, I plan to run 4 to 5 times per week.</p>
<p>I know I am slow, but everyone has to start at some point, very slow is just that starting point for me. I don&rsquo;t have any particular time/pace/distance goal in mind, but at some point running a marathon (if I can commit enough time to actually train for one) in the far future would be nice. But so far I am having fun and am taking it <strong>easy</strong>, going step by step, hence the name of this page.</p>
<p>This page will serve as a journal for my running activities and maybe also keep me accountable to not just stop it again.</p>
