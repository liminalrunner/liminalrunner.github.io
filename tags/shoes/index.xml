This week I also wore the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 for all runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (27th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (29th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (30th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (1st of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Somepoint last week, Garmins Server for all the online/sync stuff went down and still were on Monday. I still had the workout on the watch, but after it syncing worked again and it got uploaded, it didn&amp;rsquo;t register as the run that I should&amp;rsquo;ve done for the plan, so the plan assumes I missed 1 run this week.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to me, because I know I did the workout.&lt;br>
It just felt really weird how Garmins Connect App/Web Service works. Basically nothing is done on your Smartphone, you could not sync from smartphone to watch or reverse without a connection to the Garmin Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall distance: 5.14km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 3.22km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nice short run. Distance: 4.35km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same as Monday length as Monday with a distance of 5.11km this time&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This weeks Long Run was the same distance as last weeks, on this day I ran a total of 10.27km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekly distance was therefore around 24.87km / 15,45 miles, which is a little bit less than a mile more than last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shoe">Shoe&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said above, I wore the new Gaviota 2 for every run this week. They feel just right. Nothing more or less to add, very happy with that purchase!&lt;/p>

All the runs and stats below.
Also received a pair of the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 that I tried out last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was the first week with 4 workouts:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Thursday (23th of July): Run&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This was an easy effort over 4.46km. I still have a hard time keeping the same pace. The Garmin Forerunner 245 shows you the &amp;ldquo;pace window&amp;rdquo; that you should stay in but it kept beeping and vibrating because at the beginning of the run I was running faster than 8:31 min/km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Last weeks Long Run was over 8.05km / 5 Miles, this week was a step up of a Mile to 9.65km / 6 Miles which is my newest farthest distance. The complete distance for this run was exactly 10.00km. I rated this as a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; workout, because at the end of this run is was done. With this I also set a new Personal Record for the 10k distance with it being my only run to reach 10k so far with 1h28min09s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this whole week I had a distance of 23.34km / 14.5 Miles. So I ran the half-marathon, just stretched out over the week. I am pretty happy with this week. Looking forward to running more!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoka-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoka One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My pair of the Gaviota 2 (EU Size 44, Wide) arrived and I did the Thursday run in them. There is a huge difference to my Asics Gel-Fortitude 8, it just feels so much softer, in a good way. The upper material fits nicely without constricting my fat mid-foot. The soft cushioning will definitely help protecting my knees from the impact, especially on the longer runs in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t really have much more to say. See you next week!&lt;/p>

And I tried some new shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-start/">I started on this plan on Tuesday&lt;/a> this week had only 3 workouts in it and they were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday (14th): Benchmark Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (16th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (18th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Details for my Benchmark Run can be found on my last post linked above (or on the bottom of this posts).&lt;br>
After the Benchmark Run was done, the runs for the rest of the week were generated and a short video about the importance of easy runs and rest days. Which didn&amp;rsquo;t offer anything new to me, but I assume that is the standard video that also appears on all other of Coach Amys plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The plan seems to have settled on 8:31 to 8:50 min/km pace as my &amp;ldquo;easy run pace&amp;rdquo;. Which is probably super slow for everyone else, but feels good to me.
I finished the run segment with an average pace of 8:34 min/km. After every run you have to give your run an difficulty rating from the following choices:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moderate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very Hard (at least I think that&amp;rsquo;s what it was)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since this run was nice and easy, that&amp;rsquo;s what I rated it as, easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saturday-long-run">Saturday Long Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was probably my longest run so far. I actually made use of garmins route/navigation feature for this run. I planned a route in the Garmin Connect Route Planner, synced it to my watch and selected it during my run. A short distance before every direction change, the watch vibrated and displayed a little arrow to show which direction to continue on. Liked this feature a lot, this way I can stray away from my usual route, without having to keep the whole course in my mind. This is also the first run that I took something to drink with me. For that I used the CAMELBAK Quick Grip Chill Handheld Water Bottle, which is an insulated plastic bottle with a volume of 620ml / 21oz, which has a detachable handgrip with a small bag that fits a phone, id and keys for example. I filled it with water and to be sure an electrolyte tablet, I am a heavy sweater after all. The run itself was ok but i struggled at the end, the legs got heavy.&lt;br>
I had an average pace of 8:35 min/km, so well within the range I should be in. Because I struggled for the last 1.5km I rated it as a moderate difficulty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These 3 runs put me at a total distance of 17.98km for this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoke-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoke One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A friend of mine has these shoes in a similar size to mine. They are stability shoes, which was something new to me in a runnign shoe. He had them also in wide and they supposedly are the stability equivalent to the Hoka&amp;rsquo;s Bondi line, which I can&amp;rsquo;t find in wide, but was told to try. The whole stability thing didn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way at all, they felt great on a short run I did, and you can feel the difference in cushioning to my shoes. Long Story Short, I ordered a pair for myself. Hoke One One even offers to take them back after you have taken them to the streets in a 30 day period, which is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week is going to be for the full 4 runs that I set the training plan to for now. Till then!&lt;/p>

I had my first Benchmark run today for this plan and also got the New Balance 1080v10s that I ordered today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the Training Plan first, I kind of just leaned towards the Garmin Coach Training Plan because it kind of takes all the thinking out of it for me (at least I hope it does). It claims to adjusts to your performance to help you reach your goal and also has all the workouts send to my Garmin Forerunner 245 watch, so that i basically just have to press start and can go. You can also have it connect to your online calendars and see all your runs there, which is nice if you want it, I don&amp;rsquo;t use it (for now).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you start to set up your training plan, you get an overview of the 3 coaches available. Each coach has a short introduction video where they explain their methods. There is a nice blogpost over on &lt;a href="https://www.myrunnerslife.com/garmin-coach/garmin-coach-which-coach-do-you-choose/">MyRunnersLife&lt;/a> which gives an overview of all coaches if you are interested, also a view other posts about Garmin Coach. For my Half-Marathon training plan I chose Coach Amy Parkerson-Mitchell, she offered the length of the plan that I wanted (16 weeks) with 4 to 5 workouts per week. I think with Coach Greg McMillan, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the same length and Coach Jeff Galloway only had 3 workouts in a week (and I am not sold on the run/walk thing he talked about in the video). You can still switch them if you aren&amp;rsquo;t happy with the plan of one coach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have selected your coach, they have you enter some data for your plan. First is if you just want to finish your target distance or if you have are training to reach a specific time goal. I am honestly not doing this to reach any time goal, I had none in mind before starting this, but once given the option I opted to select the slowest selectable time goal, which is a half-marathon finish time of 2h40min, which is a 7:35 min/km pace. Not kidding, this seems far out of my reach, I&amp;rsquo;d be very happy just to be able to finish the half-marathon distance in a continuous run. But, knowing that I can still swap over the plan to a &amp;ldquo;just finish&amp;rdquo; section without a time goal, if I feel that I am totally out of my depth, I am going for this 2h40min time goal for now. I mean at some point I couldn&amp;rsquo;t jog for 500m and I have 16 weeks of time to try to get there. No reason not to try it.&lt;br>
Other data you need to provide is the number of workouts per week, which you can set to either 4 or 5 with Coach Amy. For now I have set it to 4.&lt;br>
Next comes your available days, which for me is always but sundays and you also have to select on which day you want to have your weekly Long Run on. For me this is Saturday.&lt;br>
And finally your &amp;ldquo;Race date&amp;rdquo; if you were training for a specific race. Since most(probably all) races are cancelled because of COVID-19 around my part of the world I just chose a Saturday 16 weeks out, which turned out to be the 31th of October.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After giving it all the data it wants, it gives you your first workout, which is a &amp;ldquo;Benchmark Run&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br>
Which was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 5 min | Run strong. Walk if you need to.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I did this today, I ran the 5min run part in a 6:35 min/km pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After syncing it back to my phone, the first week of workouts was generated, which I will give an overview of at the end of the week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said at the top, I also got 2 pairs of the New Balance 1080v10 EU Size 44, one in 2E and one in 4E widths. The 2Es were a bit too narrow on my midfoot, the 4Es fit like a glove. But, when I was just walking around, the material on top just felt to flimsy. The shoe is cut very low around the ankles and I just felt not &amp;ldquo;safe enough&amp;rdquo; in them. Now they are on their way back to New Balance.
I want to get my hands on a Bondi 6 in wide, which I was told is wider than the clifton 7 on the mid-foot, &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/weekly-update-5/">which didn&amp;rsquo;t fit my feet&lt;/a>, but they seem to be sold out everywhere in wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all for today, see you at the end of the week.&lt;/p>

Still hurt, still looking at half-marathon training plans and getting new shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of continuing rib pain, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a single run this week. Last night was the first night that I could actually sleep through again without waking up in pain because i rolled onto the wrong side. Still missing a lot of sleep, but hope to catch up soon. During the day today it barely hurt on the ribs when taking deep breaths, so looking good so far.&lt;br>
I will try my first run again as soon as it stops hurting while I breath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still am planning to start with a half-marathon training plan next but still haven&amp;rsquo;t decided which one. But if everything goes alright, I will have chosen one by next sunday and will start that on the following monday, at least that is the plan so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also ordered new shoes. So far I have been running in the Asics Gel-Fortitude 8 in 2E width and EU size 44. I have wide feet, which is a problem in Europe, because most sports stores only stock standard widths and some companies don&amp;rsquo;t even offer wide or extra-wide shoes in Europe, one of them being Saucony. For my next shoe, since I am trying to up my distance I wanted to go with a shoe that has a lot of cushioning.&lt;br>
After some research i ordered the Hoka One One Clifton 7 in 2E/wide. I got them this week, but while the toebox is huge, on the mid-foot it is just too narrow for me, I could put them on, but my foot spilled over a lot. After that I asked on the RunningShoeGeeks subreddit for some recommendations for my case. Mentioned were Altras, Brooks, Saucony Triumph and New Balance 1080v10. The Saucony Triumph would have been my first order, but I was told by their european customer service, that they only offer medium width shoes in europe. I ignored the Altras for now, because they are zero-drop, coming from a 10mm drop shoe seems a bit much of a change, especially when I will still be switching between my old and new pair of shoes. I now ordered the New Balance 1080v10 in both 2E and 4E, getting them on Tuesday. I hope on of those is a good fit. Shoe shopping has always been a pain in the ass for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for now, thanks for taking your time to read this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
