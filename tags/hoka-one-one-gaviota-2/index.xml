This week I also wore the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 for all runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This weeks runs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Monday (27th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday (29th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (30th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (1st of August): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="monday-run">Monday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Somepoint last week, Garmins Server for all the online/sync stuff went down and still were on Monday. I still had the workout on the watch, but after it syncing worked again and it got uploaded, it didn&amp;rsquo;t register as the run that I should&amp;rsquo;ve done for the plan, so the plan assumes I missed 1 run this week.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter to me, because I know I did the workout.&lt;br>
It just felt really weird how Garmins Connect App/Web Service works. Basically nothing is done on your Smartphone, you could not sync from smartphone to watch or reverse without a connection to the Garmin Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall distance: 5.14km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wednesday-run">Wednesday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 3.22km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nice short run. Distance: 4.35km&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Same as Monday length as Monday with a distance of 5.11km this time&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saturday-run">Saturday Run&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 9.65km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km | Easy pace.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This weeks Long Run was the same distance as last weeks, on this day I ran a total of 10.27km.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My weekly distance was therefore around 24.87km / 15,45 miles, which is a little bit less than a mile more than last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shoe">Shoe&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said above, I wore the new Gaviota 2 for every run this week. They feel just right. Nothing more or less to add, very happy with that purchase!&lt;/p>

All the runs and stats below.
Also received a pair of the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 that I tried out last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="training-plan">Training Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This was the first week with 4 workouts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Tuesday (21th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (23th of July): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (25th of July): Run&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This was an easy effort over 4.46km. I still have a hard time keeping the same pace. The Garmin Forerunner 245 shows you the &amp;ldquo;pace window&amp;rdquo; that you should stay in but it kept beeping and vibrating because at the beginning of the run I was running faster than 8:31 min/km.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tuesday-run">Tuesday Run&lt;/h3>

&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Last weeks Long Run was over 8.05km / 5 Miles, this week was a step up of a Mile to 9.65km / 6 Miles which is my newest farthest distance. The complete distance for this run was exactly 10.00km. I rated this as a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; workout, because at the end of this run is was done. With this I also set a new Personal Record for the 10k distance with it being my only run to reach 10k so far with 1h28min09s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this whole week I had a distance of 23.34km / 14.5 Miles. So I ran the half-marathon, just stretched out over the week. I am pretty happy with this week. Looking forward to running more!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoka-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoka One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My pair of the Gaviota 2 (EU Size 44, Wide) arrived and I did the Thursday run in them. There is a huge difference to my Asics Gel-Fortitude 8, it just feels so much softer, in a good way. The upper material fits nicely without constricting my fat mid-foot. The soft cushioning will definitely help protecting my knees from the impact, especially on the longer runs in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t really have much more to say. See you next week!&lt;/p>

And I tried some new shoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because &lt;a href="https://LiminalRunner.com/posts/garmin-coach-half-marathon-training-plan-start/">I started on this plan on Tuesday&lt;/a> this week had only 3 workouts in it and they were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday (14th): Benchmark Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday (16th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday (18th): Run&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Details for my Benchmark Run can be found on my last post linked above (or on the bottom of this posts).&lt;br>
After the Benchmark Run was done, the runs for the rest of the week were generated and a short video about the importance of easy runs and rest days. Which didn&amp;rsquo;t offer anything new to me, but I assume that is the standard video that also appears on all other of Coach Amys plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday-run">Thursday Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 4.83km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The plan seems to have settled on 8:31 to 8:50 min/km pace as my &amp;ldquo;easy run pace&amp;rdquo;. Which is probably super slow for everyone else, but feels good to me.
I finished the run segment with an average pace of 8:34 min/km. After every run you have to give your run an difficulty rating from the following choices:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Very Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moderate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Very Hard (at least I think that&amp;rsquo;s what it was)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since this run was nice and easy, that&amp;rsquo;s what I rated it as, easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saturday-long-run">Saturday Long Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm up: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run: 8.05km | 8:31 to 8:50 min/km&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool down: 2 min | Walk or jog lightly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This was probably my longest run so far. I actually made use of garmins route/navigation feature for this run. I planned a route in the Garmin Connect Route Planner, synced it to my watch and selected it during my run. A short distance before every direction change, the watch vibrated and displayed a little arrow to show which direction to continue on. Liked this feature a lot, this way I can stray away from my usual route, without having to keep the whole course in my mind. This is also the first run that I took something to drink with me. For that I used the CAMELBAK Quick Grip Chill Handheld Water Bottle, which is an insulated plastic bottle with a volume of 620ml / 21oz, which has a detachable handgrip with a small bag that fits a phone, id and keys for example. I filled it with water and to be sure an electrolyte tablet, I am a heavy sweater after all. The run itself was ok but i struggled at the end, the legs got heavy.&lt;br>
I had an average pace of 8:35 min/km, so well within the range I should be in. Because I struggled for the last 1.5km I rated it as a moderate difficulty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These 3 runs put me at a total distance of 17.98km for this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hoke-one-one-gaviota-2">Hoke One One Gaviota 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A friend of mine has these shoes in a similar size to mine. They are stability shoes, which was something new to me in a runnign shoe. He had them also in wide and they supposedly are the stability equivalent to the Hoka&amp;rsquo;s Bondi line, which I can&amp;rsquo;t find in wide, but was told to try. The whole stability thing didn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way at all, they felt great on a short run I did, and you can feel the difference in cushioning to my shoes. Long Story Short, I ordered a pair for myself. Hoke One One even offers to take them back after you have taken them to the streets in a 30 day period, which is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next week is going to be for the full 4 runs that I set the training plan to for now. Till then!&lt;/p>
